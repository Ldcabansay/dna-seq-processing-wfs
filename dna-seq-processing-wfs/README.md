# DNA sequencing reads processing workflows

This repository keeps a collect of data processing workflows for DNA-Seq. All workflows use Nextflow modules defined and released here: https://github.com/icgc-argo/dna-seq-processing-tools, here: https://github.com/icgc-argo/data-processing-utility-tools and https://github.com/icgc-argo/data-qc-tools-and-wfs. Every Nextflow module (including associated container image which is registered in Quay.io) is strictly version controlled to ensure reproducibility.
